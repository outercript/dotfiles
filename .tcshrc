# This script is provided to add backward compatibility with C Shell.
# In most systems, csh is just a symlink to tcsh, however, in some
# platforms it may not be the case and may cause problems when tcsh
# features are used.
#
# For this reason, .cshrc and .tcshrc have been split in two files to
# support such legacy systems.


# First source common definitions in the .cshrc script
source "$HOME/.cshrc"

# Now load tcsh specific scripts and features
# Source all common scripts
if ( -d "$_shellrc" ) then
  foreach file ( $_shellrc/*.tcsh )
    source $file
  end
endif

# Source all host specific scripts
if ( -d "$_localrc" ) then
  foreach file ( $_localrc/*.tcsh )
    source $file
  end
endif
